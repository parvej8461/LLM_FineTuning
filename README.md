# Fine-Tuning LLMs using LoRA and Q-LoRA

This repository contains code and resources for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and Q-LoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques. LoRA and Q-LoRA are efficient methods for adapting pre-trained LLMs to downstream tasks, allowing for faster and more memory-efficient fine-tuning while maintaining the performance of the original model.

## Overview

- **LoRA**: LoRA is a technique that introduces trainable rank decomposition matrices to the weight matrices of the pre-trained LLM. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters during fine-tuning, resulting in faster training and lower memory requirements.

- **Q-LoRA**: Q-LoRA is an extension of LoRA that quantizes the rank decomposition matrices, further reducing the memory footprint and enabling fine-tuning on devices with limited computational resources, such as CPUs or low-end GPUs.

## Features

- Fine-tune large language models (e.g., GPT-3, BERT, RoBERTa) using LoRA and Q-LoRA
- Support for various downstream tasks (text classification, question answering, language generation, etc.)
- Efficient training with reduced memory requirements
- Quantization support for Q-LoRA (INT8, INT4, etc.)
- Compatibility with popular deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)
- Example notebooks and scripts for fine-tuning and inference
